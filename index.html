    <p>I have always been drawn to electronics. Maybe it's just because of the time I was born, but the use of them always came easy to me.
        In high school, for some reason, when I attended a technical school I didn't take any sort of computer class.
        Instead, I took a woodworking program. Don't get me wrong, the class has done me a lot of good in my life,
        but I've always regretted the choice in some ways. After graduation I got a job at a pattern shot making
        wooden molds for foundries. The fine detail of the work suited me more than rough carpentry.
        After a few years I got a job manufacturing industrial ceramics at a company called Fireline Inc.
        While the pay and benifits were good, I quickly grew tired of the monotonous work. That didn't stop me from 
        doing the work for over fifteen years. Now I've taken bold action and quit my job to learn to code full time.
